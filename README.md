#### Jumpstarting localization using AppleGlot4

Have you ever localized your app for all the languages supported in the iOS environment? How many times along your career have you seen the same string translated over and over again? Have you released an open source framework that you've wished it had more translations? Whit the right setup, AppleGlot can help you resolve all these issues.
